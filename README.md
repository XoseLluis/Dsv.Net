Dsv.Net

A very simple .Net library providing access to DSV (Delimiter Separated Values) files. 
It's written in C# and will work with header and headerless files, giving you read and basic write access. You can provide the delimiter character to be used in each case, and it will be aware of line breaks or delimiters inside fields (fields wrapped in quotes).
